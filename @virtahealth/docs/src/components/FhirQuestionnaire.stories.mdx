# FhirQuestionnaire

This component takes in a FHIR Questionnaire and sends back a FHIR Questionnaire Response. Note that a parent
component must control the state of the FhirQuestionnaire or the component will not work.

Since this is a first pass, there are a few things to note:

- This will parse the FHIR Questionnaire JSON to build input fields for the item and/or its child items. If
  the item is of type `question` and it has child items, the item itself will be displayed first.

- For the sake of simplicity, `QuestionnaireResponse` that it sends back is NOT nested (even if the items were
  grouped in the questionnaire).We can iterate on how this gets built out; the nesting just made things a bit
  complicated when trying to update answers.

- Types of questionnaires to double check before using:
  - Questionnaires with multiple groups
  - Questionnaires with specific type needs
